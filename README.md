# Background Remover Web App

A full-stack web application for removing image backgrounds using [rembg](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg). This project consists of a Next.js frontend and a Flask backend.

## Features

- 🎨 **Modern UI**: built with Next.js.
- 🚀 **Real-time Preview**: Uses Blob URLs for instant "Before" image preview.
- 🖼️ **High-Quality Removal**: Powered by `rembg`.
- 📁 **Processed Image Serving**: Backend serves processed images directly from the `outputs` directory.

## Requirements 

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- CUDA Toolkit 12.x (for GPU acceleration)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **GPU Acceleration Note**
> The underlying `onnxruntime-gpu` library requires **CUDA Toolkit 12.x**. If you have **CUDA Toolkit 13.x** installed, the application will default to **CPU processing**, which may be slower.

## Troubleshooting

### CUDA Version Mismatch
If you encounter the following error, it is due to a mismatch between the installed CUDA version (files usually found in `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v13.x`) and the version required by `onnxruntime` (v12.x).

```
[E:onnxruntime:Default, provider_bridge_ort.cc:2251 onnxruntime::TryGetProviderInfo_CUDA] ... onnxruntime::ProviderLibrary::Get [ONNXRuntimeError] : 1 : FAIL : Error loading "...\site-packages\onnxruntime\capi\onnxruntime_providers_cuda.dll" which depends on "cublasLt64_12.dll" which is missing. (Error 126: "The specified module could not be found.")
```

**Solution:**
Currently, the system successfully falls back to CPU processing. To enable GPU acceleration, you would need to install CUDA Toolkit 12.x.

## Installation & Setup

### Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   # Windows
   .\env\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the server:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   The backend will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
2. Upload an image in the "Single Image" tab.
3. The original image is shown instantly (via Blob).
4. Click "Remove Background" to process.
5. The result is fetched from the backend (`http://localhost:5000/outputs/...`) and displayed.
